I'm getting married next year. This means I'll be selling my house and
moving. I've been in this house since 2001, so I'm rather well entrenched.

I'm excited about the change, but I'm not looking forward to going through
_everything_ I own and deciding what to do with it. I may need a little [Marie Kond≈ç magic](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Changing-Magic-Tidying-Decluttering-Organizing/dp/1607747308/).

There's no great rush, but I've just packed the first box of books. Of course I'm
keeping all the books.

It's begun! test
