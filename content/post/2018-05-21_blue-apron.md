I started receiving meals from [Blue Apron](https://www.blueapron.com/) five years ago today. For someone who's been
living alone, meal delivery services are wonderful. I hate shopping, I never
know what to shop for anyway, and I'm not a great cook. When I do shop I'm
forced to buy more than I need and things get thrown away. Or I just buy hot
dogs and stuff to make nachos and desserts.

Blue Apron meals are always interesting, colorful, and delicious. They take some
work to prepare, though. It seemed like I was always small-dicing what felt
like 35 ingredients at every meal. So, I started looking for alternatives.

My sister had been using [HomeChef](https://www.homechef.com/) and claimed the meals were super simple. I
switched, and she was right. They also offered a two-meal/week plan. Blue Apron
was limited to three meals. HomeChef also allowed me to choose between a nice
variety of dishes each week. With Blue Apron I just took whatever they sent.

After nearly a year, I checked in on Blue Apron and found that they had made
things simpler, now offer a two-meal plan, and have a decent selection of
meals to choose from. I switched back and couldn't be happier.

The photo above is of tonight's dish, "Tokyo Beef & Rice Bowls with Soft-Boiled
Eggs and Roasted Brocolli." I used their photo here because mine didn't turn out
looking nearly that good, but it was delicious! So good in fact that it prompted
me to write this post.

I'm happy to be back with Blue Apron. If you're looking for a meal delivery
service, I'd give the nod to Blue Apron, but you wouldn't be disappointed with
HomeChef either.
